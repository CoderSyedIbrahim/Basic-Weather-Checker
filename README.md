# Basic-Weather-Checker
I created Basic Weather Checker as a beginner-friendly web app to learn API integration. It lets users enter any city name to get the current temperature using real-time weather data. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app has a simple UI and helped me understand working with APIs.
